# Thorlar Charity Tracker

A basic charity tracking app that connects to twitch via an oauth key, and captures all chats, subs, resubs, and gifted subs. The app allows you to set values for each of those events and will automatically increment the charity value, and store it to file that OBS can read and display/update on stream.
